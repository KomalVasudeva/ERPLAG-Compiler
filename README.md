# ERPLAG

Welcome to the ERPLAG compiler. This is a toy language that was given as a semester project from the Compilers Construction course at BITS Pilani, in the year 2020. 

## Intallation
To install the compiler, run the following commands after opening a terminal in a suitable folder -

   - `git clone https://github.com/anwesh0304/ERPLAG-Compiler.git`
   - `cd ERPLAG-Compiler`
   - `./install`

If the installation fails, you can do either of the following -
1. Edit the ~/.bashrc file and export the repository directory to the PATH variable. Then execute
   - `source ~/.bashrc`
   - Restart bash
2. Copy the following files to the standard bin directory of your system -
   - .`/erplag`
   - `./.compiler`
   
## Info
   
Create your own erplag files using an extension of .erp. Use erplag -h for help on using the compiler.
The language specification document is present in the repository. Its name is "ERPLAG-Specifications.pdf"

Thank you!
