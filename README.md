Welcome to ERPLAG. This is a toy language that was given as a semester project
from the Compilers Construction course at BITS-Pilani, in the year 2020. To
install the compiler -

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine.
2. Open shell, cd into the local repository and run the installation script
by typing ./install
3. If the installation fails, you have to export the repository directory to
your PATH variable.
4. Restart the shell

Create your own erplag files using an extension of .erp
Use erplag -h for help on using the compiler.
The language specification document is present in the repository. Its name
is "ERPLAG-Specifications.pdf"

Thank you!
